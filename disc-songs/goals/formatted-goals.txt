Shine, the rest of the stars are watching
You’re awesome, you’re unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown, you’re a queen, you’re divine
That’s my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals
Don’t be bitter
Hunnie, here we are
In the mirror
Yes, you just hung up
Insecurity is doing its job
You are special
Baby, you’re a one-off
Time to start loving you, shawty, loving you
Loving you, shawty, loving you
Loving you, shawty, loving you
Loving you, shawty, loving you
Shine, the rest of the stars are watching
You’re awesome, you’re unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown, you’re a queen, you’re divine
That’s my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals
It’s temporary
That’s just how it goes (how it goes)
What I hated, now I love the most (I love the most)
Mother told me don’t let nothing stop me
'Cause ain’t no copies
Baby, you’re a one-off
Time to start loving you, shawty, loving you
Loving you, shawty, loving you
Loving you, shawty, loving you
Loving you, shawty, loving you
Shine, the rest of the stars are watching
You’re awesome, you’re unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown, you’re a queen, you’re divine
Yes, you've got a right to complain, it’s true
But look what, you’re gaining move
This message is saving you
You are in his graces too
The world entertaining you
'Cause they see the day in you
Forget who was playing you
'Cause they die in their game too
Shine, the rest of the stars are watching
You’re awesome, you’re unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown, you’re a queen, you’re divine
That’s my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals
