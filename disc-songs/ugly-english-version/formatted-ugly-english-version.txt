I don't ever want to feel like this again
Pickin' at my skin, tryna be perfect
But I feel worthless under the surface
I don't want anyone to feel like I feel
'Cause I know it's not real
It's all in my head
Come bury myself to everyone else and
Sometimes I'm not okay, but I know that it's okay
'Cause we all feel the same way
So what you're tryna say
Even when I'm at my worst
When I've been down so long it hurts
When I'm feeling ugly, know I gotta love me
'Cause I'm, I'm still beautiful
Even when they throw their sticks and stones
I'ma be stronger on my own
When I'm feeling ugly, know I gotta love me
'Cause I'm always beautiful
Everywhere I go, they want me to fit in
They don't know where I've been
Whatever you go through, you're gonna get through
Just let me show you
Sometimes I'm not okay, but I know that it's okay
'Cause we all feel the same way
So what you're tryna say
Even when I'm at my worst
When I've been down so long it hurts
When I'm feeling ugly, know I gotta love me
'Cause I'm, I'm still beautiful
Even when they throw their sticks and stones
I'ma be stronger on my own
When I'm feeling ugly, know I gotta love me
'Cause I'm always beautiful
Love me, love me
When I'm feeling ugly, ugly
Know I gotta love me, love me
'Cause I'm always beautiful
Even when I'm at my worst
When I've been down so long it hurts
When I'm feeling ugly, know I gotta love me
'Cause I'm, I'm still beautiful
Even when they throw their sticks and stones
I'ma be stronger on my own
When I'm feeling ugly, know I gotta love me (I gotta love me)
'Cause I'm always beautiful (love me)
Love me, love me
When I'm feeling ugly, ugly
Know I gotta love me, love me (love me)
'Cause I'm always beautiful
