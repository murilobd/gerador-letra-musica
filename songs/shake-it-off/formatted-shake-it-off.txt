I stay up too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, hmm, hmm
That's what people say, hmm, hmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, hmm, hmm
That's what people say, hmm, hmm
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off, uh, uh, uh
I'll never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, hmm, hmm
That's what they don't see, hmm, hmm
I'm dancing on my own
I'll make the moves up as I go
And that's what they don't know, hmm, hmm
That's what they don't know, hmm, hmm
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off, uh, uh, uh
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off, uh, uh, uh
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off, uh, uh, uh
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty dirty cheats of the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
My ex-man bought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh, my God"
But I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake
(Yeah, oh) 'cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off, uh, uh, uh
Shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off, uh, uh, uh
Shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off, uh, uh, uh
