I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, baby
Looking for you, baby
Searching for you, baby
Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd
[Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah]
Where have you been?
All my life, all my li-i-i-i-ife...
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, baby
Looking for you, baby
Searching for you, babe
Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd
[Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah]
Where have you been?
All my life, all my life...
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
Where have you been, all my li-i-i-ife?
You can have me all you want anyway, any day
To show me where you are tonight, ooh, yeah, ooh
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, baby
Looking for you, baby
