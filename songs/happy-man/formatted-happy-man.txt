Merely by chance
Very unsuspected
You caught my heart
Unprotectin' me
Now I'm fallin in love with you
Just when I thought
I was free and easy
You came along
To me soft and breezy
Now I've fallen in love with you
Woo hoo
I've fallen in love with you
And for the first time in my life
I know what it's like to be a happy man
Happy man
And for the first time in my life
You've given me something I can understand
Bein' a happy man
Be with me now
Love me forever
Leavin' you lady
Was something that I'd never do
I've fallen in love with you
All of my life it seems I have waited
Now I can say all these words I have stated are true
I've fallen in love with you
Woo hoo
Fallen in love with you
Woo hoo
