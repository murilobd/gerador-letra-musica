I’m yours, la la la la, la la la la
I’m yours, la la la la, la la la la
I’m yours
Feels good whenever in touch
Your body in mine pass me up
Just like the Sun
We’re like the sky
One shoot you’re mine
Desire, fire
What you do takes me higher
Stars, sky
Belong to us
Give me the night and I’ll show you paradise
Give me the night
Just fall in love, I feel the hunger in your eyes
Give me the night
Give me all, give me the night
Give me all, give me
A rush, your hands on my skin not enough
Your body in mine pass me up
Just like the sun
We’re like the sky
One shoot you’re mine
Desire, fire
What you do takes me higher
Stars, sky
Belong to us
Give me the night and I’ll show you paradise
Give me the night
Just fall in love, I feel the hunger in your eyes
Give me the night
I’m yours, la la la la, la la la la
(Give me all, give me the night)
I’m yours, la la la la, la la la la
Desire, fire
What you do takes me higher
Stars, sky
Belong to us
Give me the night and I’ll show you paradise
Give me the night, oooo oo ooo
Just fall in love, I feel the hunger in your eyes
Give me the night, oooo oo ooo
Give me the night and I’ll show you paradise
Give me the night, oooo oo ooo
Just fall in love, I feel the hunger in your eyes
Give me the night, oooo oo ooo
