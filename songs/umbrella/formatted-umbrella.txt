Aham, aham
Yeah, rihanna
Aham, aham
Good girl gone bad
Aham, aham
Take three, action
Aham, aham
No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame (eh eh)
Coming down with the dow jones
When the clouds come we gone
We roc-a-fella (eh eh)
We fly higher than weather
In g5's or better
You know me, an anticipation, for precipitation
Stacked chips for the rainy day (eh eh)
Jay, rain man is back
With little ms. Sunshine, rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart
And we'll never be world apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, we can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has delt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
(There's no distance in between our love)
So gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's raining (raining)
Ooh, baby it's raining (raining)
Baby come into me, come into me
It's raining, raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining (raining)
You can always come into me, come into me
It's pouring rain
