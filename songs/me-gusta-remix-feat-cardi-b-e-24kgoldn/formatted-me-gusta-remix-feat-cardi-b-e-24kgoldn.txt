Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (24K)
If you like what you see
Baby, you should come with me
Know this spot up out in Rio
I can fuck you on the beach
I'm your type, what it seems
E eu sei que português
Shawty got a lil dinero
So it's double Gs and Cs
Been watching you, get wild
Been wanting me, just found out
Don't come around town, but I'm there if you down
One phone call figure shit out
Been holding back, I know
Get hotter than fogo
Good looking ass, that's what I'm looking at
You already know
A mí me gustan las mujeres
When they shake their ya ya ya
A mí me gusta when they want
They go and get it, ya ya ya
A mí me gu-uh-uh
A mí me gu-uh-uh
A mí me gu-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh (La Cardi)
He like to eat the cake like it's my b-day (b-day)
Y todo' lo' día' es mi cumpleaños (años)
Boy, I like it rough, don't take it easy (easy)
Gangsta, yeah, I like it in the bando
Me gustan los machos y que coman cuca
Que haciendo el amor, me jalen la peluca
Él me dijo que le fascina mi bunda
A mí me gusta el dinero, no te confunda'
I like girls that kiss on girls
Eso me pone on fire, ya-ya
I like working, I like murking
All my haters, ya-ya-ya, yeh
Yo tengo el sazón de una afrolatina
Y muevo mi cintura como Shakira
La Cardi y Anitta, two fly mamacitas
Bad bitches, me gustan toditas
A mí me gustan las mujeres
When they shake their ya ya ya
A mí me gusta when they want
They go and get it, ya ya ya
A mí me gu-uh-uh
A mí me gu-uh-uh
A mí me gu-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh (tra)
Eh, yeh
Yah, yah, yah (tra)
Yeh, yeh
Yah, yah, yah (tra)
I don't know what you're used to
But I know that you have never tried something like this
I don't know what you're used to
But it doesn't matter, 'cause I know you gonna like this
Eso que tienes ahí
Lay it down to my body
Lo que tú quieras de mí
Do whatever, you got me
Been holding back, I know
Get hotter than fogo
Good looking ass, that's what I'm looking at
You already know
A mí me gustan las mujeres
When they shake their ya ya ya
A mí me gusta when they want
They go and get it, ya ya ya
A mí me gu-uh-uh
A mí me gu-uh-uh (La Cardi)
A mí me gu-uh-uh (La Cardi y Anitta, two fly mamacitas)
