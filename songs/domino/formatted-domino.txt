I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm 'bout to explode
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running
Cause you're taking me there
Don't you know
You spin me out of control
Uuh uuh uuh uh
We can do this all night
Turn this club skin tight
Baby come on
Uuh uuh uuh uh
Pull me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on!
Uuh uuh uuh uh
Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
