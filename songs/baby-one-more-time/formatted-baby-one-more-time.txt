Oh baby, baby,
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby,
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because…
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
