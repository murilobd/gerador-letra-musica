If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’, baby
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, I said you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’, baby
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar, so, goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
I know you lie (lie)
'Cause your lips are moving (moving)
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (young), but I ain't stupid (stupid)
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (bass), you gave me sweet talk (sweet talk)
Saying how I’m your number one
But I know you lie (lie)
Your lips are moving (moving)
Baby, don't you know I'm done?
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm, mmm
That's what people say, mmm, mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm, mmm
That's what people say, mmm, mmm
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off (whoo, whoo, whoo)
