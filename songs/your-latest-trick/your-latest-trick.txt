 <p>All the late night bargains have been struck<br>Between the southern beaus and their belles<br>And prehistoric garbage trucks<br>Have the city to themselves<br>Echoes and roars of dinosaurs<br>They're all doing the monster mash<br>And most of the taxis, most of the whores<br>Are only taking calls for cash</p><p>I don't know how it happened<br>It all took place so quick<br>But all I can do is hand it to you<br>And your latest trick</p><p>My door was standing open<br>Security was laid back and lax<br>But it was only my heart got broken<br>You must have had a pass key made out of wax<br>You played robbery with insolence<br>And I played the blues on twelve bars down on Lover's Lane<br>And you never did have the intellegence to use<br>The twelve keys hanging off my chain</p><p>I don't know how it happened<br>It all took place so quick<br>But all I can do is hand it to you<br>And your latest trick</p><p>Now it's past last call for alcohol<br>Past recall has been here and gone<br>The landlord finally paid us off<br>The satin jazzmen have put away their horns<br>And we're standing outside of this wonderland<br>Looking so bereaved and so bereft<br>Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands<br>The bottle's empty and there's nothing left</p><p>I don't know how it happened<br>It was faster than the eye could flick<br>But all I can do is hand it to you<br>And your latest trick</p>
