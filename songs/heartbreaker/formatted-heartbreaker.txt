Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Oh, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst
Of you, and I
Cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby?
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?
Heartbreaker
You've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why
Did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known
Right from the start you'd go
And break my heart
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Heartbreaker
You've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why
Did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known
Right from the start you'd go
And break my heart
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
