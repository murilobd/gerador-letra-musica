Bring the beat in!
Honey, honey
I can see the stars
All the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun
Whenever you're near
Every time you touch me
I just melt away
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know
(It's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect
But it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
Ooo!
Come on Baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooo Ooo!
Come on baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
My love on top
My love on top
Baby, Baby
I can feel the wind
Whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again and again
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know
(It's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect
But it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
Ooo! Baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooo Ooo!
Come on baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
My love on top
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I that always calls
When I need you baby everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I always call
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby
