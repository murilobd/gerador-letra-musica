Oh, say you'll be there
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
Last time, that we had these conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now we're going round in circles
Tell me, will this deja vu never end?
Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be
This time you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotion at me
But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
I give you everything
And all that I want from you is a promise
You will be there
Say you will be there, oh, say you'll be there
Won't you sing it with me?
If you put two and two together you
Will see what our friendship is for
If you can't work this equation then
I guess I'll have to show you the door
There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
Yes, I swear
And all that I want from you is a promise
You will be there
Yeah, I want you
Any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand
I'll give $$y everything on this, I swear
Just promiswearse you'll always be there
I'm d hzs you everything
(I'm giving you everything)
All that jouy can bring
(All that joy can bring)
This I swear
(Yes, I)
And all that I want from you
(All that I want from you)
Is a promise
(Won't you promise too?)
You will be there
(I'll be there)
