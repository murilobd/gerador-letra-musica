(Is that for me?)
Ooh, come a little bit closer
Come and get a little piece of mine, yeah
Let me take over
Nothing wrong with feeling right
Oh no, don't be selfish
It's getting late, look at the time
Been thinking about it all day
What we're gonna do about it tonight?
Up against the wall, up against the wall
No holding back now
No tapping out now
No turnin' back now
Catching feelings, no, catching feelings, no
Let's go away now
Savor the taste now
Wanna know now
Is that for me?
Is that for me?
Is that for me?
Ooh, lemme back up on it
Hold on, we're going for a ride, yeah
'Ready know you want it
Know you wanna take all my time
But you can't be stingy
Gotta gimme, gimme what I like
Been thinking about it all day
What we gon' do tonight?
Up against the wall, up against the wall
No holding back now (oh, no)
No tapping out now (oh, no)
No turnin' back now
Catching feelings, no, catching feelings, no
Let's go away now
Savor the taste now
Wanna know now
Is that for me?
Is that for me?
Is that for me?
Is that for me?
Is that for me?
Is that for me?
