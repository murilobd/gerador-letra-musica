You wanna skip the conversation
Sayin' you're getting impatient
Boy, you must have me mistaken
'Cause you gotta make it worth my time
I can't judge your first impressions
You been wanting my attention
So if you got the right intention
Maybe I might let you change my mind
You got your foot down on the pedal
Now you planning how to make a move
Trying anything to get me next to you
I know you wanna get to know me
But I ain't sure if you can handle it
Can you read it on my body?
I know you wanna taste it on my lips
Show me what you could afford me
Tell me all about the benefits
You really wanna get to know me
But I ain't sure if you can handle it
I know you want the lights down low and my clothes off
Pretty little thing on your arm you can show off
It's gonna take more than a drink, you should know that
(You should know that) you should know that
You're gonna have to put in more than a minute
Treat me like a queen, show me now that you're in it
Will you stick around through the night
If you get it, if you get it? Yeah
You got your foot down on the pedal
Now you planning how to make a move
Trying anything to get me next to you
I know you wanna get to know me
But I ain't sure if you can handle it
Can you read it on my body?
I know you wanna taste it on my lips
Show me what you could afford me
Tell me all about the benefits
You really wanna get to know me
But I ain't sure if you can handle it
I know you wanna know me
Put your body on my body
Trying anything to get me next to you
I know you wanna know me
Put your body on my body
Trying anything to get me next to you
I know, I know, I know
Oh, put your body on my body
