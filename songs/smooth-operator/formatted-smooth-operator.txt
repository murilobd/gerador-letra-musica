Diamond life lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste
And maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire
For higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator

Coast to coast, l.a. To chicago, western male
Across the north and south to key largo, love for sale
Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
