So Friday I went to see DJ Snoopadelic DJ
And while he was DJing I walked up to him and asked him for a picture
And he told me no
And I said: No?
You know what he said? (UbitchU)
No, not her, I'm talkin' about you (UbitchU)
This is what I'ma say to you when I see you (UbitchU)
Out my face, out my space, give me room (UbitchU)
Shit's hot, tick-tock, let it boom (UbitchU)
All that sugar, all that cake and all that spice (UbitchU)
I ain't frontin', I said it once and I ain't sayin' it twice (UbitchU)
Alright now, I need all the ladies to the dance floor, right now
