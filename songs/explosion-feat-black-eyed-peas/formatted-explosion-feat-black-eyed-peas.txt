Hey
You know who I am
Girl, you fucking with a winner
I'm the man, I'm the man
The other bombaclats are pretenders
Boy, you know who I am
No, I am no beginner
I make it hotter than the Sun
Fire, fire, fire, I'm a sizzler
You buck 'em down, buck 'em down, down, down
R치, dig-din-din-ding, r치, destroyer
When they down, when they down, down, down
Tell 'em who, tell 'em who I am, am, boy
You the bomb, you the bomb, you the bomb
You the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Here it come, here it come, here it come
E-eXplosion
You the bomb, you the bomb, you the bomb
You the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Here it come, here it come, here it come
E-eXplosion
Na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na

Somebody call the security
This girl over here is killing me
She got that goddess symmetry
Killing me softly with the symphony
I fell in love with the melody
I'm listening to everything she's telling me
I'm buying everything that she's selling me
Girl, being that fine should be a felony
You the bomb, you the bomb, you the bomb
You the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
E-eXplosion
You the bomb, you the bomb, you the bomb
You the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Here it come, here it come, here it come
E-eXplosion
Na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na

When it's time for the war
Yeah, I turn into a warrior
I go hard to the core
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a destroyer
Oh my, oh my
Girl, you bad, you dangerous
You fly, so fly
Girl, you a killer and angel
I buck 'em down, buck 'em down, down, down
R치, dig-din-din-ding, r치, destroy
Oh, when they down, when they down, down, down
Girl, you know how to kill-kill-kill a boy
You the bomb, you the bomb, you the bomb
You the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Here it come, here it come, here it come

DJ, give them something now
Let's connect like YFi
WiFi all night, you my wifey
Put the ring on the finger for life me
We do it, just do it like Nike
Girl, I'm loving your geometry
I can see your future, optometry
I can see you sitting on top of me
Girl, I like when you drop, drop the bomb on me
Na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na
