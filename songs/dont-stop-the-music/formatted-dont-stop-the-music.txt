Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
It's getting late
I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate (yeah)
Who knew,
That you'd be up in here looking like you do
You're making staying over here impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't...
Do you know what you started
I just came here to party
But now we're rocking on the dance floor
Acting naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand
Chest to chest
And now we're face to face
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rocking to it
Please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
