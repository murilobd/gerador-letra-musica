When it's all said and done, will I see you?
When it's all said and done, will I see you?
Now that my love is on
All the way on you, I won't turn it off
Would you do the same?
When it's all said and done, will I see you?
I've been planting seeds in our ground
Watching us grow for a while
Pray the sun stays shinin' down on us
I hope it do
We committed our trust out loud
Like gravity, we swore to hold each other down
Build a circle, pray you always stay around
I do, Lord knows I do
Met you on the block
You ain't gotta hustle like that no more
I've been on a journey
I ain't tryna look back, no more
We've been on a wave
Tryna not make it back to shore, oh, no
But when it's all said and done, will I see you?
When it's all said and done, will I see you?
Now that my love is on
All the way on you, I won't turn it off
Would you do the same?
When it's all said and done, will I see you?
Took away my insecurities
Your arms became my security
Ooh, my melody became harmony with you
And only you
Sometimes reality kicks in
Realizing every beginning comes to an end
Can I go to sleep at night
Knowing I'll wake up to my best friend?
When it's all said and done, will I see you? (Will I see you?)
When it's all said and done, will I see you? (I need to know)
Now that my love is on
All the way on you, I won't turn it off
Would you do the same?
When it's all said and done, will I see you? (Will I see you?)
Met you on the block
You ain't gotta hustle like that no more
I've been on a journey
I ain't tryna look back, no more
We've been on a wave
Tryna not make it back to shore (make it back to shore), oh, no
So when it's all said and done will I see you? (Will I see you?)
When it's all said and done, will I see you? (And only you)
Now that my love is on
All the way on you, I won't turn it off
Would you do the same?
When it's all said and done, will I see you?
