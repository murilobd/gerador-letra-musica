Baby let's cruise
Away from here
Don't be confused
The way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
This is not a one night stand, baby
Yeah so
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Baby tonight
Belongs to us
Everything's right
Do what you might
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other
Oh, baby, yeah
So let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruise with me, baby
Oooooohhh yeah
Oooooohhh (ooh, ooh)
Oooh baby let's cruise
Let's float
Let's glide
Ooh let's open love
And go inside
And if you want it, you got it forever
I could just stay here beside you and love you, baby
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when
I love it
I love it
I love it
(Oh)
(Cruise with me, baby)
(I love it when we're cruisin' together)
