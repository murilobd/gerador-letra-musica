Dance or die, die, die, die (loca, loca)
She's playing dumb all the time
Just to keep it fun
To get you on like "ah"
Be careful, amigo
She's talking and walking
Just to work you up
And she'd died for your love
But your love's only mine, now
Yo sigo tranquila
Like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona
Like there's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leaving you alone
What is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it
So give him up
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it
You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she's got it all
I got my kiki
You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she's got it all
I got my kiki
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca, loca
Loca
