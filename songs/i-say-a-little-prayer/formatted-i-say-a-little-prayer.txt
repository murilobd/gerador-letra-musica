The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (make up)
I say a little pray for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only meen heartbreak for me
I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear (us, dear)
I say a little prayer for you
At work, I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time
I say a little prayer for you
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
Nobody would be
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
My darling, believe me (believe me)
For me, there is no one but you!
Please, love me too
And I'm in love with you (answer my pray)
Answer my prayer, babe (answer my pray)
Say you love me too (answer my pray)
Answer my pray, babe (answer my pray)
Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
My darling believe me (believe me)
For me there is no one but you!
Please, love me too
Answer my pray
Answer my pray now, babe
Answer my pray
Answer my pray now, babe
I'm in love with you
Answer my pray
Answer my pray now, babe
