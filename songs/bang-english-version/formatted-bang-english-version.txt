Come, come, baby
I can see you wanna touch me, yeah
I want it and you know that I like it my way
Bang! (bang)
My eyes left a bullseye on you
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do
I'mma make it happen, gotta be my way
When 'n how we come close
Tell me if you gonna be a man
I'm the type to always take command
If you really want this you cannot be late, hesitate
I can dominate you
Come out on top like I do
Turn your head around
I wanna see you, feel you
I know how to shock you
No one does it like I do
And I won't stop, I'm gonna tease you, baby
Come, come baby
I can see you wanna touch me, yeah
I want it and you know that I'm lookin' away
